It's impossible to perfectly distribute 80 hours of study across 35 days while maintaining a strict topic-per-day schedule and aligning perfectly with the round structure.  Some days will necessarily cover multiple topics.  This plan prioritizes consistent daily study and attempts to balance topic coverage across rounds, recognizing some overlap is inevitable.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Adjust as Needed:** This is a template. Adjust the daily hours and topic focus based on your learning pace and strengths/weaknesses.
* **Practice Coding:** Dedicate significant time to practicing coding problems on platforms like LeetCode, HackerRank, and Codeforces. This is crucial for DSA.
* **Mock Interviews:**  Mock interviews are incredibly valuable.  Try to simulate the real interview environment as much as possible.
* **Prioritization:** If you find yourself falling behind, prioritize the topics most crucial for your target companies.


This revised plan aims for a more realistic and balanced approach. Remember flexibility is key!  Good luck with your preparation!
